 LiDARFind underwent comprehensive testing to ensure functionality, user engagement, and compatibility across various platforms. Both manual and automated testing methods were employed to scrutinise every aspect of the website and has been documented here.

 # AUTOMATED TESTING
 Automated testing was undertaken using a range of open-source developer tools including Google Lighthouse Analysis, HTML, CSS and JavaScript validation. These tests assessed the quiz's quality, performance, accessibility and adherence to web standards. Any identified issues were addressed to enhance the websites usability and overall user experience.

 ## HTML

 To test the markup validity [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to assess markup validity and compliance with accessibility standards. THe following table shows the results for each page:

### HTML Validation Test Results

#### * Detailed Issue Report: Admin Dashboard

- **Date:** 23/07/24
- **Issue:** Duplicate IDs are being generated in the HTML for user and record elements.
- **Description:** 
  - When rendering the Admin Dashboard page, duplicate IDs were being generated due to the use of loop indices (`{{ loop.index }}`) for ID generation within nested loops. This caused validation errors and potential conflicts in element manipulation.
- **Solution:**
  - The HTML template was updated to use unique identifiers for user and record elements, specifically `{{ user._id }}` and `{{ record._id }}`, to ensure that each element has a unique ID.
- **Status:** Issue resolved, the Admin Dashboard now passes HTML validation with no errors or warnings.

## CSS Validation

The CSS code of the website was validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). The validation results are as follows:

### Noted Issue

1. **Error Detected**:
   - **Property**: `font-optical-sizing`
   - **Value**: `auto`
   - **Description**: The property `font-optical-sizing` doesn't exist in CSS.

### Action Taken

The property `font-optical-sizing: auto;` was removed from the CSS to resolve the validation error.

This ensures that the CSS code is fully compliant with web standards and free of validation errors.


## JSHint

### script.js Testing Report

| Metric                                      | Value                                    |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Total number of functions**               | 18                                       |
| **Function with the largest signature**       | 1 argument                               |
| **Median number of arguments per function** | 0                                        |
| **Largest function (statements)**           | 7 statements                             |
| **Median number of statements per function**  | 2 statements                             |
| **Most complex function (cyclomatic)**      | Cyclomatic complexity value of 2          |
| **Median cyclomatic complexity**            | 1                                        |

**Unused Variables**

The following variables were initially flagged by JSHint as unused but are actually used in the HTML for functionality:
- `tooltipList`: Used for initialising Bootstrap tooltips.
- `openCreateForm`: Used to open the create record form.
- `closeCreateForm`: Used to close the create record form.
- `openFilter`: Used to open the filter section.
- `closeFilters`: Used to close the filter section.

These were fixed by adding the `/* exported ... */` directive at the top of the JavaScript file to inform JSHint that these variables are used externally.

| **Median number of statements per function**  | 2.5 statements                           |
| **Most complex function (cyclomatic)**      | Cyclomatic complexity value of 7             |
| **Median cyclomatic complexity**            | 1                                        |

**Unused Variables**

The following variables were initially flagged by JSHint as unused but are actually used in the HTML for functionality:
- `openDeleteModal`: Used for opening the confirmation delete modal

These were fixed by adding the `/* exported ... */` directive at the top of the JavaScript file to inform JSHint that these variables are used externally.

**Undefined Variable**
- **One undefined variable**: `isAdmin` on line 89.

This warning occurs because the `isAdmin` variable is declared in the HTML template and not directly within the JavaScript file. 

To manage the isAdmin variable effectively and ensure it reflects the user's actual status, I am declaring it in the HTML using server-side templating. This approach allows the backend to pass the isAdmin status dynamically based on the authenticated user's role. Hereâ€™s the declaration in the HTML:

html
Copy code
`<script>
    var isAdmin = {{ is_admin|tojson }};
</script>`

By doing this, isAdmin is available globally in our JavaScript files without the need to redeclare it, ensuring it accurately represents the user's admin status. Despite JSHint flagging isAdmin as an undefined variable in the JavaScript files, the script works as expected because the variable is defined in the HTML before any JavaScript execution.

This method ensures the isAdmin variable is dynamic and secure, reflecting the actual status of the user logged in, and avoids hardcoding it to true or false within the JavaScript code. This approach maintains the integrity of our application by ensuring that only users with the correct admin privileges can access certain functionalities.

To suppress the JSHint warning,  /* global isAdmin */  is added to the directive at the top of the JavaScript file. 

This informs JSHint that isAdmin is a globally defined variable, resolving the warning while ensuring the code remains functional and clear.

| **Largest function (statements)**           | 6 statements                             |
| **Median number of statements per function**  | 1 statements                           |
| **Most complex function (cyclomatic)**      | Cyclomatic complexity value of 7             |
| **Median cyclomatic complexity**            | 1                                        |


**Undefined Variable**
- **One undefined variable**: `L`

This warning occurs because the `L` variable, provided by the Leaflet library, is defined globally and not within the JavaScript file itself. 

To resolve this warning `/* global L*/` is added to the directive at the top of the JavaScript file. 
This directive informs JSHint that `L` and `bootstrap` are globally defined variables, preventing the tool from flagging them as undefined. 
This ensures that the code is correctly validated without unnecessary warnings, while maintaining the functionality provided by these libraries.

| **Most complex function (cyclomatic)**      | Cyclomatic complexity value of 2             |
| **Median cyclomatic complexity**            | 1.5                                        |

**Undefined Variable**
- **One undefined variable**: `L`

This warning occurs because the `L` variable, provided by the Leaflet library, is defined globally and not within the JavaScript file itself. 

To resolve this warning `/* global L*/` is added to the directive at the top of the JavaScript file. 
This directive informs JSHint that `L` and `bootstrap` are globally defined variables, preventing the tool from flagging them as undefined. 
This ensures that the code is correctly validated without unnecessary warnings, while maintaining the functionality provided by these libraries.

## Lighthouse Analysis
Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to assess the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO rating of the website. The analysis was conducted on both mobile and desktop devices, and the scores were recorded for each page of the website. The table below illusrates the results of the analysis.

From the table above it is evidence that pages containing maps displayed significantly lower performance and accesibility scores, particularly on mobile devices. It seems plausible to suggest that the presence of the leaflet maps was contributing to the reduced scores.

To test this hypothesis a comparative analysis was carried out, this time removing the map elements from the affected pages. The results are recorded in the table below:

### Without Map

| Page             | Performance       |                | Accessibility     |                | Best Practice     |                | SEO            |                |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|                  | Mobile (%)        | Desktop (%)    | Mobile (%)        | Desktop (%)    | Mobile (%)        | Desktop (%)    | Mobile (%)     | Desktop (%)    |
| Home             | 60                | 93             | 95                | 95             | 100               | 96             | 100            | 100            |
| Record           | 88                | 97             | 95                | 95             | 96                | 96             | 100            | 100            |
| Edit record      | 83                | 99             | 95                | 96             | 96                | 100            | 100            | 100            |

The performance scores for mobile devices show a marked improvement when the leaflet map is removed from the pages. For example, the Home page perforamnce incrases from 45% to 60% on mobile.
The difference is less pronounced for desktop performancce scores, which are generally higher with or without the map. 
The accessibility scores are not consistently reported when the map elements were present. Once removed the scores are unoformly higher. 
The best practice and SEO scores are consistently high with and without map elements, indicting they are not affected by the leaflet map. 

By running the Lighthouse analysis twice - first with the maps included and then with the maps removed - it is possible to identify that the performance and accessibility are impacted by leaflet maps. This method provided a concrete basis for understanding how dynamic, interactive elements like maps can affect web page metrics, particularly on mobile devices. The inclusion of the Leaflet map appears to introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly affecting the mobile experience. This is likely due to the additional JavaScript and rendering required to display and interact with the map. By deferring the loading of non-essential scripts and styles or optimising the map integration, it might be possible to mitigate some of these performance impacts. However, the map provides significant functionality and value to the user experience, so these trade-offs need careful consideration.

In a final effort to increase performance and accessibility of the home page, particularly on mobile devices, "Lazy Loading" using intersection Observer was implemented to defer the loading of the map element on the home page until it enters viewport.

### With Lazy Loading using Intersection Observation

| Page             | Performance       |                | Accessibility     |                | Best Practice     |                | SEO            |                |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|                  | Mobile (%)        | Desktop (%)    | Mobile (%)        | Desktop (%)    | Mobile (%)        | Desktop (%)    | Mobile (%)     | Desktop (%)    |
| Home             | 48                | 91             | 95                | 95             | 75               | 100            | 100            | 100            |


By implementing lazy loading for the map element using the intersection observer it was possible to mitigate some of the performance and accessibility impacts. This approach defers the loading time of the map until it enters the viewport, thus reducing the intial load time. 

In hindsight, I realise that including an interactive element such as a map on the home page may not have been the best decision. For a marketing website, this could potentially lead to a significant bounce rate as the performance and accessibility impacts might deter users from staying on the page.

However, given that this website is map-oriented and heavily relies on displaying geographical data, the inclusion of a map on the home page serves an essential purpose. It aligns with the primary functionality and user expectations of the site. Therefore, under these specific circumstances, the performance trade-offs are justified and likely not to cause significant issues.

Additionally, I tested other websites that rely heavily on maps, including Google Maps and Rightmove, and observed that they also have low scores for performance. This observation suggests that the inclusion of interactive maps inherently impacts performance metrics, yet these websites still provide significant value and usability despite the lower scores

### Other Notable Observations From Lighthouse Analysis
During the Lighthouse analysis of the Home Page, several warnings were flagged in the console, indicating "Third party cookie is blocked in Chrome as part of Privacy Sandbox." These warnings appear to be related to external libraries associated with wistia rather than being part of my own codebase. When running Lighthouse in incognito mode, these warnings were not flagged, suggesting that these third-party cookies are blocked due to Chrome's enhanced privacy settings in regular browsing mode. 
These warnings were not logged in the console when viewing the site using safari browser. 
These warnings do not direcly impact the core functionality of the website.

# MANUAL TESTING

## Feature Testing:

## Role-Based Access Control
LiDARFind employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions effectively. There are two types of users on the website: standard users and admins. RBAC ensures that only admins have access to restricted pages and functionalities. During the registration process, a hidden boolean field `is_admin` is set to `false` by default, designating the new user as a standard user. This field can be manually updated to `true` to grant administrative privileges to the user.

To confirm that each user type had the appropriate level of access, various scenarios were tested for both standard users and admins. The following table documents the test cases and results:


| Test Case | Objective | Process | Outcome |
|------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| Administrator Access     | Confirm that administrators have unrestricted access to all sections of the site.    | 1. Log in as an Administrator.<br>2. Navigate through all sections of the website, including the admin dashboard.<br>3. Verify the ability to access and perform administrative tasks such as editing/deleting records of any user and deleting users.   | Administrators had full access to all sections and functionalities, performing administrative tasks without any restrictions. |
| Standard User Access     | Ensure that standard users are limited to accessing only their own profile and are restricted from administrative areas. | 1. Log in as a Standard User.<br>2. Access the userâ€™s profile.<br>3. Attempt to navigate to the admin dashboard.                                                                                                             | Standard users were correctly restricted to their own profiles and were denied access to the admin dashboard.        |
| URL Manipulation Checks  | Detect unauthorised access attempts through direct URL manipulation.                 | 1. Log in as one user type and note accessible URLs.<br>2. Log out and switch to a different user role.<br>3. Attempt to access the noted URLs directly by typing them into the browser.                                    | Unauthorised access attempts were effectively blocked, ensuring that users could not bypass role restrictions through URL manipulation. |
| Admin Role Protection    | Ensure that the 'Administrator' role cannot be selected or assigned during the user registration process. | 1. Navigate to the registration page.<br>2. Verify that the 'Administrator' role is not available for selection.<br>3. Attempt to manually set the role to 'Administrator' using form manipulation techniques. | The 'Administrator' role was not available for assignment during registration, ensuring that only designated users could become admins. |


### Conclusion

These tests confirm that our RBAC implementation is effective in restricting access based on user roles, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the website. Each role functions as intended, with administrators having full access and standard users being appropriately limited.

# USER FEEDBACK
User feedback was sought to help enhance the website and tailor it to meet user needs. Below is a summary of the feedback received from user testing:

## Navigation and Usability

**Navigation:** Most users found the navigation intuitive, though some suggested that the website's target audience should be clarified (novices vs. knowledgeable users).

**Registration:** The registration process was straightforward and easy to complete.

**Creating, Editing, and Deleting Records:** Users were able to create, edit, and delete records without any issues.

**General Appearance:** The website was described as professional, uncluttered, and visually appealing, with a user-friendly profile section for managing records.

## Features and Functionality

**Liked Features:** Users appreciated the ease of accessing the entire LiDAR coverage of Wales and the professional look of the website.

**Disliked Features:** Some users noted that when a record is made, the map zooms out and the LiDAR layer turns off, which can be inconvenient if searching in a specific area.

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Additional Features:** Suggestions included more LiDAR data layers at higher resolutions and features to manipulate LiDAR data, such as 3D visualisation.

**Tooltips:** Users found the tooltips clear and informative but suggested adding a description for PRN to improve clarity for all users.

## Responsiveness and Bugs

**Device Responsiveness:** The website performed well across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) with no reported issues.

**Bugs and Errors:** No significant bugs or errors were encountered during testing.

**Map View Switching:** Users were able to switch between different map views successfully.

## Educational Resources

**Video Tutorial:** The video tutorial on the home page was helpful in understanding how to use the website, with positive feedback on its quality.

## Recommendations

**Likelihood to Recommend:** Users indicated they are likely to recommend the website to others interested in LiDAR data, particularly for professional projects and citizen science initiatives.

## Changes Made Based on Feedback

**Navigation Improvement:** Set the layers list on the map to always be expanded for users not familiar with interactive maps.

**Tooltip Enhancement:** Added a description of PRN to the tooltip for clarity.

## Future Development Considerations

**Map Zoom Issue:** Investigating a solution to maintain the current zoom level and layer settings after making a record to enhance user experience.


# BUGS
## Fixed Bugs

### Conflict Between Materialize and Leaflet Layer Controls

**Issue:** When integrating the Materialize CSS framework and Leaflet for interactive maps into the application, radio buttons for toggling base layers in the Leaflet layer control were not visible. This made it impossible for users to switch between different base map layers.

**Solution:** The root cause was identified as a CSS conflict between Materialize and Leaflet frameworks, where Materialize's default styles were interfering with Leaflet controls. Using Dev Inspector Tools, the class selector for the layer controls was identified. Custom CSS was then implemented to properly display radio buttons. Materialize CSS sets the opacity of radio buttons to "0", so this was changed to "1" to ensure the Leaflet layer controls displayed correctly.

![Custom CSS to display layer controls](readme-images/code-snippets/custom-leaflet-css.png)

**Outcome:** After applying these CSS rules, the radio buttons for base layers and checkboxes for overlay layers in the Leaflet layer control were displayed correctly and were fully functional. This solution ensured that users could interact with the map layers as intended, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.

### MongoDB '_id' Field Cannot be Directly Used in JSON

**Issue:** When retrieving data from a MongoDB database and attempting to return it as a JSON response, an error occurred due to the presence of the _id field. The _id field in MongoDB is an ObjectId type, which cannot be directly represented in JSON.

**Solution:** To resolve the issue, the '_id' field needs to be either excluded from the retrieved data or converted to a string representation before returning it as a JSON response.

**Outcome:** By excluding the _id field the application can successfully return the retrieved data as a JSON response without encountering errors related to the ObjectId type used by MongoDB for the _id field.

### Data Fetching Issue with MongoDB Cursor

**Issue** When fetching data from MongoDB and using it multiple times within the same template, the data did not render correctly. This issue arose because the data was retrieved as a cursor, which can only be iterated over once. After the first use, the cursor was exhausted, making the data unavailable for subsequent uses within the template. This problem particularly impacted the rendering of dropdown options on the record page, where the same data was needed for both the "Create Record" form and the search filters. As a result, the data was only available for the first use, and subsequent attempts to access it resulted in no data being rendered.

**Solution** Convert the cursor to a list immediately after fetching the data. This ensures that the data is fully retrieved and can be used multiple times within the template.

**Outcome** The data can now be used in more than one dropdown, resolving the issue and ensuring consistent data rendering across the template.

### Prefilling Input Texts

**Issue** When dynamically entering adding coordinate data to the record form the placeholder labels were overlapping the prefilled text. 

**Solution** Call the function M.updateTextFields(); to reinitialize all the Materialize the labels on the page (source: Materailize).

**Outcome** When the input field is auto-populated with the coordinates the placeholder text moves in to the active state and no longer overlaps the input. 

### Navbar Pushed Page Content Down on Smaller Screens

**Issue** When the navbar is expanded on smaller screens, it pushes the page content down instead of overlaying it. This causes the layout to shift unexpectedly, affecting the user experience.

**Solution** To resolve the issue, the CSS for the navbar was updated to use position: absolute, ensuring the navbar overlays the page content instead of pushing it down. Additionally, padding was added to the body to prevent content from being hidden behind the navbar. The following CSS was added:

**Outcome**  By applying the position: absolute property to the navbar and adding padding-top to the body, the navbar now overlays the page content when expanded on smaller screens. This prevents the content from being pushed down and ensures it is not hidden behind the navbar, maintaining a consistent layout and improving the overall user experience.

### Referrer Parameter Not Carried Over in Form Submission

**Issue:** When editing a record, the referrer parameter (`ref`) was not being carried over during the form submission, causing the application to redirect to the wrong page after saving or canceling the edit. The `ref` parameter, included in the query string, was not available in the POST request.

**Solution:** To resolve this issue, the `ref` parameter needs to be included as a hidden input field within the form. This ensures that the `ref` value is part of the form data sent during the POST request. The `edit_record` route was updated to retrieve the `ref` value from the form data instead of the query string.

**Outcome:** By adding the `ref` parameter as a hidden input field in the form and retrieving it from the form data in the `edit_record` route, the application can correctly determine the referrer and redirect users to the appropriate page (profile or add_record) after editing a record. This ensures that users are redirected back to the page they originated from, improving the user experience.

### Location Field Editable After Validation Causes Map Rendering Issues

**Issue:** When creating a new record, the location field is required as it is essential for creating a marker. However, after the form is validated, users were able to edit the location field, including removing it completely, and then submit the form. This causes the record to lack a marker due to missing location information, and subsequent records, even with valid locations, did not display on the map. Deleting the record with the missing location information from the database restored the map rendering for subsequent records.

**Solution:** To resolve the issue, JavaScript was used to make the location field 'read-only' after the location information had been entered. This prevents users from removing the location after form validation.

**Outcome:** By making the location field read-only after entry, users can no longer remove essential location information post-validation, ensuring that all records display their markers correctly on the map and maintaining the integrity of the map rendering process.

### Browser Back Button Cache Issue

**Issue:** Issue: If a user logs in and then uses the back button of the browser, they are returned to the login page. If they try to log in as someone else at this point, it will fail, and they will continue to the profile page of the first login. Additionally, if a user logs out and then uses the back button on the browser, they are taken to a cached version of their profile. It may appear as if the user is logged in, but functionality such as edit and delete is not available.

**Solution:** To prevent users from navigating back to the login page once logged in using the URL, the following line of code was added:

`if "user" in session:
    return redirect(url_for("profile", username=session["user"]))`

To prevent users from using the back button to return to the login page or a cached profile after logging out, the following code was added:

`def add_header(response):
    response.cache_control.no_store = True
    return response
`

This function ensures that the browser does not store cache for the logged-out state, preventing the display of a cached profile page.

**Outcome:** After implementing these changes, users are redirected correctly based on their session status. If a user attempts to navigate back to the login page after logging in, they are redirected to their profile page. Additionally, after logging out, users cannot use the back button to access a cached version of their profile, ensuring that the application behaves securely and as expected.
