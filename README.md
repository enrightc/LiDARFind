### Conflict Between Materialize and Leaflet Layer Controls

**Issue:** When integrating the Materialize CSS framework and Leaflet for interactive maps into the application, radio buttons for toggling base layers in the Leaflet layer control were not visible. This made it impossible for users to switch between different base map layers.

**Solution:** The root cause was identified as a CSS conflict between Materialize and Leaflet frameworks, where Materialize's default styles were interfering with Leaflet controls. Using Dev Inspector Tools, the class selector for the layer controls was identified. Custom CSS was then implemented to properly display radio buttons. Materialize CSS sets the opacity of radio buttons to "0", so this was changed to "1" to ensure the Leaflet layer controls displayed correctly.

**Outcome:** After applying these CSS rules, the radio buttons for base layers and checkboxes for overlay layers in the Leaflet layer control were displayed correctly and were fully functional. This solution ensured that users could interact with the map layers as intended, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.
