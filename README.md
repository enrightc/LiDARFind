#### Relationships
**User to Records:**
Each user (in Users collection) can create multiple records (in Records collection).  
The `created_by` field in the Records collection references the `username` in the Users collection.

**Records to Site_types:**
Each record in the Records collection references a `site_type` from the Site_types collection.  
The `site_type` field in the Records collection matches the `site_type` in the Site_types collection.

**Records to Periods:**
Each record in the Records collection references a `period` from the Periods collection.  
The `period` field in the Records collection matches the `period_name` in the Periods collection.

**Site_types to Monument_types:** 
Each site type in the Site_types collection contains multiple related monument types.  
The `monument_types` array within the Site_types collection holds this nested relationship.

#### Example Use Case

**Registration**

A new user registers and their details are stored in the Users collection.

**Create Record**

The user creates a new record by selecting a site type and monument type from the Site_types collection and a period from the Periods collection.  
The record is then stored in the Records collection with references to the selected `site_type` and `period`.

**View Records**

The user can view records they created by fetching documents from the Records collection where the `created_by` field matches their username.

#### Why MongoDB
MongoDB, a non-relational database, was chosen for this project because of its flexibility and scalability. Unlike traditional relational databases, MondoFB allows for a flexible schema design, which is particularly beneficial for handling varied and evolving data structures like archaeological records. 
  - Flexible Schema: MongoDB allows for a flexible schema design, meaning new fields can be added to documents without affecting existing ones. This is useful for dealing with diverse and evolving data types.
  -Â Document-Based Model: MongoDB's document-based model allows related data to be stored together in a single document, which simplifies data retrieval and improves performance. For example, site types and their associated monument types are stored together.
  - Scalability: MongoDB can handle large volumes of data and supports horizontal scaling, which is beneficial as the project grows and more records are added.
  - Performance: MongoDB allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, ensuring a responsive user experience when dealing with large datasets.


**Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
To illustrate the structure and relationships of the collections in the MongoDB database, an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created. The ERD visually represents the relationships between users, site types, periods, and records, making it easier to understand how the data is interconnected.

![Entity-relationship Diagram](readme-images/databse-diagram.png)


## Skeleton Plane
Prior to commencing the website coding process, comprehensive wireframes were produced for each page using Figma - a design tool used for creating user interfaces, prototypes, and wireframes. These wireframes served as the initial blueprints, providing a visual roadmap for the website's layout and structure on both desktop and mobile devices.

It's important to note that while the final web pages evolved from these early plans, some deviations were intentionally made to enhance the user experience and align better with the project's goals. The website design relied heavily on using Leaflet frames, and much of the development involved adapting and optimizing these frames to meet the site's objectives. This required significant modifications and iterations as the project progressed.

This iterative process allowed for flexibility in adapting to evolving project requirements, ultimately contributing to the development of a more refined and user-friendly website.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
For the LiDARFind project, the chosen colour scheme embraces a minimalistic approach, ensuring that the primary focus remains on the maps and the data they present. The design aims to be sleek and sophisticated, mirroring the advanced technology of LiDAR. Key elements, such as call-out buttons, are designed to stand out without overwhelming the user.

**Primary Colours**
   - **Background Colour: #e1eaec**
      - The main background colour is a light, muted blue-grey (#e1eaec). This colour provides a modern and professional aesthetic, creating a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for the content.
**Accent Colours**
  - **Navbar and Footer Colour: #263238** 
    - The navbar and footer are highlighted in a dark blue-grey (#263238). This colour helps these sections stand out, providing a clear structure to the layout and emphasising important navigation and information areas.
  - **Primary Button Colour: #4CAF50**
    - The primary buttons, such as "Create Record," are highlighted in a vibrant green (#4CAF50). This colour is selected for its visibility against the background, ensuring that call-to-action elements are easily identifiable.
  - **Primary Button Hover Colour: #45a049**
    - On hover, the button colour shifts to a slightly darker green (#45a049), providing a clear visual feedback to the user and enhancing the interactive experience.

To ensure a consistent colour palette, the primary colour (#263238) was input into [UI Colors](https://uicolors.app/create). This tool generated complementary colours that were used consistently throughout the website, enhancing the overall visual appeal and user experience.

![UI Design Colour Scheme](readme-images/ui-colours.png)

This colour scheme supports a professional and clean interface, where the focus is on usability and clarity. By keeping the design elements understated, users can concentrate on the primary functions and content of the website, such as exploring maps and creating records, without unnecessary distractions.

### Fonts
In the LidarFind project, typography is essential for achieving a modern and sophisticated look while ensuring readability across all content. The primary font used throughout the website is 'Inter', sourced from Google Fonts.

Inter, designed by Rasmus Andersson, a Swedish designer and software developer, is gaining popularity in the digital world. Created specifically for computer interfaces, Inter excels in making small text legible. Its open apertures, tall x-height, and unique letterforms enhance readability in digital contexts, especially in UI design where space is limited. The design considerations for digital legibility make Inter a valuable typeface for modern web projects (Source: https://uxplanet.org/the-only-8-fonts-you-will-ever-need-eb4e4088cb16).

For headings, 'Inter' adds a touch of professionalism and clarity, making important information stand out. The same font is applied to paragraph text to maintain a unified and consistent visual identity across the interface.

To ensure the text remains legible and visually appealing, a Sans Serif font serves as the fallback option. This guarantees that even if 'Inter' fails to load, the text will still be clear and easy to read.

By consistently using 'Inter' across the website, the design achieves a seamless and polished look, enhancing the user experience and ensuring that all information is easily accessible.

### Accessibility
Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of the LidarFind project, ensuring that all users, regardless of ability, can fully interact with the content.

**Colour Contrast:** The colour palette is designed with high contrast in mind, improving readability and ensuring that text and other content stand out against the background. This thoughtful approach provides a visually accessible experience for everyone.

**Font Selection:** Emphasising simplicity and readability, the fonts chosen are clear and easy to read. This choice ensures that the content remains legible for users with different visual abilities, fostering an inclusive user experience.

# BUGS
## Fixed Bugs

### Conflict Between Materialize and Leaflet Layer Controls

**Issue:** When integrating the Materialize CSS framework and Leaflet for interactive maps into the application, radio buttons for toggling base layers in the Leaflet layer control were not visible. This made it impossible for users to switch between different base map layers.

**Solution:** The root cause was identified as a CSS conflict between Materialize and Leaflet frameworks, where Materialize's default styles were interfering with Leaflet controls. Using Dev Inspector Tools, the class selector for the layer controls was identified. Custom CSS was then implemented to properly display radio buttons. Materialize CSS sets the opacity of radio buttons to "0", so this was changed to "1" to ensure the Leaflet layer controls displayed correctly.

![Custom CSS to display layer controls](readme-images/code-snippets/custom-leaflet-css.png)

**Outcome:** After applying these CSS rules, the radio buttons for base layers and checkboxes for overlay layers in the Leaflet layer control were displayed correctly and were fully functional. This solution ensured that users could interact with the map layers as intended, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.

### MongoDB '_id' Field Cannot be Directly Used in JSON

**Issue:** When retrieving data from a MongoDB database and attempting to return it as a JSON response, an error occurred due to the presence of the _id field. The _id field in MongoDB is an ObjectId type, which cannot be directly represented in JSON.

**Solution:** To resolve the issue, the '_id' field needs to be either excluded from the retrieved data or converted to a string representation before returning it as a JSON response.

**Outcome:** By excluding the _id field the application can successfully return the retrieved data as a JSON response without encountering errors related to the ObjectId type used by MongoDB for the _id field.

### Data Fetching Issue with MongoDB Cursor

**Issue** When fetching data from MongoDB and using it multiple times within the same template, the data did not render correctly. This issue arose because the data was retrieved as a cursor, which can only be iterated over once. After the first use, the cursor was exhausted, making the data unavailable for subsequent uses within the template. This problem particularly impacted the rendering of dropdown options on the record page, where the same data was needed for both the "Create Record" form and the search filters. As a result, the data was only available for the first use, and subsequent attempts to access it resulted in no data being rendered.

**Solution** Convert the cursor to a list immediately after fetching the data. This ensures that the data is fully retrieved and can be used multiple times within the template.

![Converting Cursor to List](readme-images/code-snippets/converting-cursor-list.png)

**Outcome** The data can now be used in more than one dropdown, resolving the issue and ensuring consistent data rendering across the template.

### Prefilling Input Texts

**Issue** When dynamically entering adding coordinate data to the record form the placeholder labels were overlapping the prefilled text. 

**Solution** Call the function M.updateTextFields(); to reinitialize all the Materialize the labels on the page (source: Materailize).

![Converting Cursor to List](readme-images/code-snippets/updateTextFields-code-snippet.png)

**Outcome** When the input field is auto-populated with the coordinates the placeholder text moves in to the active state and no longer overlaps the input. 

### Navbar Pushed Page Content Down on Smaller Screens

**Issue** When the navbar is expanded on smaller screens, it pushes the page content down instead of overlaying it. This causes the layout to shift unexpectedly, affecting the user experience.

**Solution** To resolve the issue, the CSS for the navbar was updated to use position: absolute, ensuring the navbar overlays the page content instead of pushing it down. Additionally, padding was added to the body to prevent content from being hidden behind the navbar. The following CSS was added:

![CSS to prevent navbar pushing page content down](readme-images/code-snippets/navbar-css.png)

**Outcome**  By applying the position: absolute property to the navbar and adding padding-top to the body, the navbar now overlays the page content when expanded on smaller screens. This prevents the content from being pushed down and ensures it is not hidden behind the navbar, maintaining a consistent layout and improving the overall user experience.

### Referrer Parameter Not Carried Over in Form Submission

**Issue:** When editing a record, the referrer parameter (`ref`) was not being carried over during the form submission, causing the application to redirect to the wrong page after saving or canceling the edit. The `ref` parameter, included in the query string, was not available in the POST request.

**Solution:** To resolve this issue, the `ref` parameter needs to be included as a hidden input field within the form. This ensures that the `ref` value is part of the form data sent during the POST request. The `edit_record` route was updated to retrieve the `ref` value from the form data instead of the query string.

**Outcome:** By adding the `ref` parameter as a hidden input field in the form and retrieving it from the form data in the `edit_record` route, the application can correctly determine the referrer and redirect users to the appropriate page (profile or add_record) after editing a record. This ensures that users are redirected back to the page they originated from, improving the user experience.

### Location Field Editable After Validation Causes Map Rendering Issues

**Issue:** When creating a new record, the location field is required as it is essential for creating a marker. However, after the form is validated, users were able to edit the location field, including removing it completely, and then submit the form. This causes the record to lack a marker due to missing location information, and subsequent records, even with valid locations, did not display on the map. Deleting the record with the missing location information from the database restored the map rendering for subsequent records.

**Solution:** To resolve the issue, JavaScript was used to make the location field 'read-only' after the location information had been entered. This prevents users from removing the location after form validation.

**Outcome:** By making the location field read-only after entry, users can no longer remove essential location information post-validation, ensuring that all records display their markers correctly on the map and maintaining the integrity of the map rendering process.

# DEPLOYMENT
### MongoDB Non-Relational Database
This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the non-relational database. 

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:

1. Name the database should be **lidar_find**
2. The collections needed for this database should are **"users", "periods", "site_type", "monument_type" and "records" .
3. Click on the database name name created for the project (LiDARFind).
4. Click on the Connect button.
5. Click Connect Your Application.
6. Copy the connection string, and replace password with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Deploying on Heroku
This project uses Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications entirely in the cloud. Using a PaaS removes the need for building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launcing an app. 

Once an account has been registered the following deployment steps can be followed:

1. In the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, click "New" and choose "Create new app" from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter a unique name for your app, select the region closest to your location (EU or USA), and then click "Create App".
3. Navigate to the Settings tab of your newly created app, click on "Reveal Config Vars," and configure your environment variables accordingly.

| Key          | Value            |
|--------------|------------------|
| DATABASE_URL | user's own value |
| IP           | 0.0.0.0          |
| MONGO_DBNAME | user's own value |
| MONGO_URI    | user's own value |
| PORT         | 5000             |
| SECRET_KEY   | user's own value |

To deploy your project on Heroku, you need to include two essential files:

  - requirements.txt
  - Procfile

To install the project's dependencies (if applicable), run the following command:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you've installed additional packages, update the requirements file with:
`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

Create the Procfile with this command:
`echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

Replace app.py with the name of your main Flask application file located at the root level.

Note: Ensure the Procfile starts with an uppercase 'P' and has no file extension.

For connecting your GitHub repository to your Heroku app, follow these steps:

**Option 1:** Use Automatic Deployment from the Heroku app dashboard.

**Option 2:**

In your terminal or command-line interface (CLI), log in to Heroku:
`heroku login -i`

Set Heroku as a remote repository:
`heroku git:remote -a app_name`
Replace app_name with your actual app name.

After staging and committing your changes to GitHub, push your code to Heroku:
`git push heroku main`

Your project should now be connected and deployed on Heroku.

### Local Deployment
You can either clone or fork this project to create a local copy on your system.

After doing so, you need to install the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file by running:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Create a new file named env.py at the root level of your project. Include the environment variables mentioned in the Heroku deployment steps.

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("Port", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DB", "lidar_find")
```
